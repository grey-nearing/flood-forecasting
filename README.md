# **OpenHydroNet: Riverine Flood Forecasting**

## **🌊 This repository implements the state-of-the-art models that power [Google FloodHub](https://sites.research.google/floods/).**

This is not an officially supported Google product. This project is not eligible for the Google Open Source Software Vulnerability Rewards Program.

The repository provides open-source replication of Google’s global flood-forecasting models. By open-sourcing these models, we aim to foster transparency, enable in-house integration in production systems, and accelerate academic research.

This repository is a fork of [NeuralHydrology](https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology), which has been heavily modified and extended to support forecast sequences using the specific model architectures that are used operationally in the Google FloodHub.

## **Models**

This repository contains implementations of the core models used in Google's production forecasting systems.

### **Mean-Embedding-Forecast-LSTM**

The [Mean Embedding Forecast LSTM](https://github.com/google-research/flood-forecasting/blob/main/googlehydrology/modelzoo/mean_embedding_forecast_lstm.py) is a forecasting model that uses separate embedding networks for hindcast and forecast inputs. It aggregates these inputs using masked means before passing them into respective LSTMs for the hindcast and forecast periods.

* **Status:** **Current production model** (as of December 2025\) for [Google FloodHub](https://sites.research.google/floods/).  
* **Reference:** Gauch, Martin, et al. "[How to deal with missing input data](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/29/6221/2025/)." *Hydrology and Earth System Sciences* (2025).

### **Handoff-Forecast-LSTM**

The [State Handoff Forecast LSTM](https://github.com/google-research/flood-forecasting/blob/main/googlehydrology/modelzoo/handoff_forecast_lstm.py) is a forecasting model that uses a state-handoff to transition from a hindcast sequence (LSTM) model to a forecast sequence (LSTM) model. The hindcast model runs from the past up to the present (the issue time of the forecast) and then passes the cell state and hidden state of the LSTM into a (nonlinear) handoff network, which is used to initialize a new LSTM that rolls out over the forecast period.

* **Status:** Former production model for [Google FloodHub](https://sites.research.google/floods/).

1. **Create and Activate the Environment:**  


   ```
   # Create the environment from the file in the repo  
   conda env create -f environments/conda.yml

   # Activate the environment (MANDATORY)  
   conda activate googlehydrology  
   ```
    
3. Install the Package:  
   Install in editable mode so that changes to the source code are reflected immediately:  


   ```
   # Run from the root of the repository  
   pip install -e .
   ```

## **🚀 Tutorial Notebook**

The most direct way to explore this repository is through our interactive tutorial: [**OpenHydroNet Tutorial Notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/flood-forecasting/blob/main/tutorial/OpenHydroNet_Tutorial.ipynb).

**What you will learn:**

* **Model Evaluation:** Load pre-trained Google Hydrology models and calculate performance metrics (NSE, KGE) on real-world basin data.  
* **Fine-Tuning for Performance:** Learn how to fine-tune the `static_embedding_fc` layer. This is a powerful technique for improving predictions on "outlier" basins (e.g., basins with unusual sizes or geology) without retraining the entire model.
* **Visualizing Results:** Compare model hydrographs against observed discharge data.

## **Data Setup**

OpenHydroNet standardizes entirely on the high-performance, cloud-native **Zarr** format for streamflow targets, static attributes, meteorological forcings, and normalizer scalers.

### **1. Caravan Data (Zarr Format)**

Caravan data is structured into modular Zarr stores:
* `attributes.zarr`: Catchment static attributes (area, elevation, soil, geology).
* `streamflow.zarr`: Gauge streamflow observations.

If you have downloaded the legacy Caravan NetCDF/CSV dataset from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6522634), convert it to Zarr in a single step using the built-in CLI:

```bash
run convert-caravan --caravan-dir ~/data/Caravan-nc --output-dir ~/data/Caravan-zarr
```

### **2. MultiMet Dynamics Data**

The MultiMet meteorological forcing data extension is accessed directly from **Google Cloud Storage** or local disk. Point your configuration to: `gs://caravan-multimet/v1.1` (or your local dynamics directory).

### **3\. Catchment Delineation (Creating Polygons for New Gauges)**

If you have latitude and longitude coordinates for streamflow gauges and need their upstream watershed boundary polygons and drainage areas ($\text{km}^2$), use the `delineate-catchment` command-line tool included in this repository. It traces upstream drainage areas across 90-meter flow-direction map tiles and writes polygons in Caravan-compatible GeoParquet, GeoJSON, or Shapefile format for downstream MultiMet and static attribute extraction.

* **Package Guide & CLI Reference:** [`catchment_delineation/README.md`](catchment_delineation/README.md)
* **Official Documentation:** [`docs/source/usage/catchment_delineation.rst`](docs/source/usage/catchment_delineation.rst)
* **MultiMet Forcing Data:** See **MultiMet Data** above (`gs://caravan-multimet/v1.1`).

#### Building Your Own Gridded Weather Archives (Optional)

Most users do not need to build weather archives—pointing `dynamics_data_dir` to `gs://caravan-multimet/v1.1` is all that is needed to train and evaluate models.

If you want to download raw gridded precipitation data directly from NOAA (CPC) or NASA (IMERG) and build your own Zarr archives, use the command-line tools in the [`multimet/gridded_archive_builders`](multimet/gridded_archive_builders/README.md) package (`build-cpc-archive` and `build-imerg-archive`). See [`multimet/gridded_archive_builders/README.md`](multimet/gridded_archive_builders/README.md) and the [Gridded Weather Archives documentation](docs/source/usage/gridded_archives.rst) for usage instructions and command-line arguments.

## **Usage**

The package installs the run command as the primary entry point.

### **Training a Model**
   
   ```
   run train --config-file /path/to/your/training_config_file.yml
   ```

### **Evaluation**

Calculate performance metrics (NSE, KGE) on the test set:
   
   ```
   run evaluate --run-dir /path/to/your/model_run/
   ```

### **Inference**

Generate predictions (without skipping NaN observations):
   
   ```
   run infer --run-dir /path/to/your/model_run/
   ```

## **Configuration**

Experiments are defined by YAML files. Update the following paths in your config (e.g., tutorial/training-config.yml):

* run\_dir: Where weights and logs are saved.  
* train\_basin\_file: Path to the list of basin IDs.  
* data\_dir: Path to your root directory containing `attributes.zarr`, `streamflow.zarr`, and dynamic meteorological data (e.g., `~/data/Caravan-zarr`).
* statics\_data\_path / targets\_data\_path: Optional paths to individual component Zarr stores.
* dynamics\_data\_path: Path to forcing data (e.g., `gs://caravan-multimet/v1.1` or local directory).

### **Example Configurations**

The `~/flood-forecasting/example-configs` directory contains reference YAML files that define the experimental setups for different model architectures and datasets.

* **`floodhub-settings-config.yml`**  
  * **Model Architecture:** `mean_embedding_forecast_lstm`  
  * **Dataset:** MultiMet (Global Caravan dataset)  
  * **Description:** This configuration is designed to replicate the training settings of the current (2025) operational FloodHub model as closely as possible within this open-source framework.  
* **`handoff-forecast-lstm-config.yml`**  
  * **Model Architecture:** `handoff_forecast_lstm`  
  * **Dataset:** MultiMet (Global Caravan dataset)  
  * **Description:** Provides the settings used for the former operational model. This configuration aligns with the methodology described in the *Nature* (2024) paper for global ungauged flood prediction.

Our team uses this as a reference point during model development, and it is included in this repository because this is what we use to ensure that any changes to the repository work as expected.  
* **`camels-multimet-handoff-forecast-lstm-config.yml`**  
  * **Model Architecture:** `handoff_forecast_lstm`  
  * **Dataset:** CAMELS-US (531 basins)  
  * **Description:** A benchmarking configuration for the State Handoff model tailored for the CAMELS-US dataset, used to compare the handoff approach against other architectures on US-based basin data.

## **Extracting Static Attributes for Your Own Watersheds**

To run OpenHydroNet models on a watershed, the model needs a table of static watershed characteristics (such as area, elevation, slope, soil type, land cover, and long-term average climate). For basins in the published [Caravan](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01975-w) dataset, these tables are already included.

If you want to run models on **your own watersheds**, this repository includes a static data workflow (`multimet/static_extractor`) that takes a map file of your watershed boundaries (`.geojson`, `.shp`, or `.gpkg`) and builds a Caravan-compatible CSV table of static attributes using the community [HydroATLAS](https://www.hydrosheds.org/hydroatlas) and [ERA5-Land](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/) datasets.

```bash
extract-caravan-static \
    --input /path/to/watershed_polygons.geojson \
    --output /path/to/extracted_caravan_attributes.csv \
    --gdb-path /path/to/BasinATLAS_v10.gdb \
    --era5-source hybas \
    --era5-cache-dir /path/to/era5_climate
```
