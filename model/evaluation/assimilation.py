"""Gradient-based (variational) data assimilation of latent model components.

For every batch, the components listed in the assimilation config (for
example the static and dynamic embeddings of ``MeanEmbeddingForecastLSTM``)
are treated as free variables over an assimilation window that ends at the
forecast issue time, i.e. ``lead_time`` steps before the end of the targets.
They are optimized so that the model's prediction matches the observations
inside the window, while a background term keeps them close to the model's
unassimilated (prior) values. The model weights are never changed.

Objective
---------
Every sequence of the batch is an independent problem. The observation term
is the configured loss with ``per_sequence=True`` (averaged within each
sequence over its valid observations, then over sequences) and the background
term (``BackgroundEmbeddingRegularization``) is likewise a mean over
sequences of a scale-normalised squared departure (the departure of every
sequence is divided by the mean square of its own prior, so
``regularization_weight`` is dimensionless). Sequences without a valid
observation in the window are excluded from both reductions and kept at the
prior, and the batch mean is rescaled to a sum over the remaining sequences,
so every sequence receives the gradient it would receive on its own.

Model interface
---------------
The engine only relies on the model

* validating component names in ``validate_assimilation_components(names)``,
* returning those components from ``forward(data, return_embeddings=True)``,
* accepting optimized values through the keyword arguments
  ``forward(data, assimilation_overrides=..., assimilation_slice=...)``,
  where time-varying components (``[B, T, ...]``) are passed for the window
  only and static components (``[B, ...]``) as a whole,
* reducing its outputs to a ``[B, T, n_targets]`` tensor in
  ``point_prediction(outputs)``.

Missing data
------------
Missing observations are handled by the masked losses. Non-finite values are
handled per sequence: a sequence whose gradient (or updated value) is not
finite is frozen at its last finite value for the rest of the run and
reported once; the run is aborted (returning the last finite values) only if
the total loss itself is not finite. The whole procedure runs in float32 with
autocast disabled, independently of the caller's autocast state.

Optionally, sequences whose prediction at the end of the window is already
close to the observation stop being optimized (``early_stopping_tolerance``).

    of the full observed sequence (0 if it is all missing), so that the error
