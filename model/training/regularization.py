class BackgroundEmbeddingRegularization(BaseRegularization):
    """Background (prior) term for variational data assimilation.

    In gradient-based (variational) data assimilation, latent model components
    (e.g. embeddings or initial states) are optimized so that the model better
    fits recent observations. This term keeps the optimized components close to
    the values the model produced without assimilation (the background), which
    regularizes the otherwise ill-posed inversion.

    For every component ``c`` (batch dimension first), the squared departure
    from the background is averaged over the valid non-batch entries and
    divided by the detached mean squared magnitude of the background of the
    same sequence plus a small epsilon, i.e. a diagonal background-error
    scaling that is constant within a sequence::

        valid_c[i]     = isfinite(optimized_c[i]) & isfinite(baseline_c[i])
        dep_c[i]       = mean_{valid}((optimized_c[i] - baseline_c[i]) ** 2)
        scale_c[i]     = mean_{valid}(baseline_c[i] ** 2) + eps
        term           = sum_c w_c * mean_{i in V_c}(dep_c[i] / scale_c[i])

    where ``V_c`` is the set of sequences with at least one valid entry.

    Non-finite entries (e.g. NaN embeddings the model produces for missing
    input steps) are masked out of both the departure and the scale, so they
    neither poison the term nor receive a gradient. Sequences without a single
    valid entry are skipped in the mean over sequences; if no sequence of a
    component is valid, that component contributes zero.

    The normalisation makes the term, and therefore ``regularization_weight``,
    dimensionless and comparable across components of different magnitude and
    across models. Baselines are detached so no gradient flows into them.
    ``_EPS`` (1e-3) is deliberately not tiny: it prevents the normalisation
    from amplifying departures from backgrounds with a near-zero norm, where
    the ratio would otherwise blow up.

    The term is computed in float32 regardless of the input dtype and cast
    back to the dtype of the optimized tensors at the end: in float16 the
    ratio ``departure / scale`` overflows to ``inf`` for moderately large
    departures and the masked sums lose precision.

    Inputs are strict: ``other_model_data`` must contain non-empty
    ``optimized_components`` and ``baseline_components`` dictionaries, every
    optimized component needs a baseline, every component needs a batch
    dimension (``ndim >= 2``), and the shapes must match exactly. Violations
    raise ``ValueError`` instead of silently contributing zero. Components
    whose weight is exactly zero are skipped before their tensors are touched,
    so they can never contribute (not even a NaN).

    The tensors are passed through the ``other_model_data`` argument of
    `BaseLoss.forward`, which merges them into the third argument of this
    module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cfg : Config
        The run configuration.
    weight : float, optional
        Global weight of the regularization term. Default: 1.
