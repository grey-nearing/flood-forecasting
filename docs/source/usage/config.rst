Configuration Arguments
=======================

This page lists all supported YAML configuration arguments in OpenHydroNet.
See ``model/tutorial/configs/train-config.yml`` and ``model/example-configs/floodhub-settings-config.yml`` for complete working examples.

General experiment configurations
---------------------------------

-  ``experiment_name``: Defines the name of your experiment that will be used as a folder name (+ date-time string), as well as the name in TensorBoard. Curly brackets insert other configuration arguments into the experiment name. For example, ``experiment_name: batch-size-is-{batch_size}`` will yield ``batch-size-is-42`` if the ``batch_size`` argument is set to *42*. Furthermore, ``{random_name}`` provides a randomly named string (e.g., ``yellow-frog``).
-  ``run_dir``: Full or relative path to where the run directory is stored. If empty, runs are stored in ``${current_working_dir}/runs/``.
-  ``train_basin_file``: Full or relative path to a text file containing the training basins (use dataset basin id, one id per line).
-  ``validation_basin_file``: Full or relative path to a text file containing the validation basins.
-  ``test_basin_file``: Full or relative path to a text file containing the test basins.
-  ``train_start_date``: Start date of the training period (``DD/MM/YYYY``). Can be a list of dates to specify multiple periods.
-  ``train_end_date``: End date of the training period (``DD/MM/YYYY``).
-  ``validation_start_date``: Start date of the validation period (``DD/MM/YYYY``).
-  ``validation_end_date``: End date of the validation period (``DD/MM/YYYY``).
-  ``test_start_date``: Start date of the test period (``DD/MM/YYYY``).
-  ``test_end_date``: End date of the test period (``DD/MM/YYYY``).

-  ``device``: Device to use, e.g., ``cuda:0``, ``cpu``, or ``mps``.
-  ``logging_level``: Console and log-file verbosity level (``DEBUG``, ``INFO``, ``WARNING``, ``ERROR``, or ``CRITICAL``). Default: ``INFO``.
-  ``detect_anomaly``: True/False. If ``True``, enables PyTorch autograd anomaly detection (``torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True)``) to pinpoint operations that produce ``NaN`` or ``Inf`` gradients during training. Default: ``False``.
-  ``cache``: A dictionary with keys ``enabled`` (bool) and ``byte_limit`` (int) to control opportunistic in-memory caching of data.

Validation settings
-------------------

-  ``validate_every``: Integer that specifies in which interval (in epochs) a validation is performed. If empty, no validation is done during training.
-  ``validate_n_random_basins``: Integer specifying how many random basins to use per validation (use ``-1`` or ``0`` to validate on all basins).

-  ``save_validation_results``: True/False. If True, stores validation results to disk in a Zarr store.

Evaluation settings
-------------------

-  ``inference_mode``: True/False. If True, saves observed data and model output to disk and does not skip dates with missing observations.
-  ``tester_sample_reduction``: ``mean`` or ``median``. How to reduce multiple samples (e.g., from CMAL) during evaluation.

-  ``clip_targets_to_zero``: List of target variable names (e.g., ``[streamflow]``) for which negative predictions are clipped to zero during evaluation.
-  ``hot_start_path``: Optional path to a saved LSTM state file (``.npz``) or a directory of per-basin state files (``state_<basin>.npz`` or ``<basin>.npz``) used to warm-start the model's hidden and cell states before running evaluation or inference. Requires ``batch_size: 1``.
-  ``save_state``: True/False. If ``True``, saves each basin's final LSTM hidden and cell states to ``<run_dir>/hot_start_states/state_<basin>.npz`` at the end of validation, evaluation, or inference. Default: ``False``.

-  ``cmal_deterministic``: True/False. Use deterministic 10-point sampling (mean + 9 quantiles) for CMAL.
-  ``negative_sample_handling``: Approach for handling negative sampling. Possible values are ``none`` for doing nothing, ``clip`` for clipping the values at zero, and ``truncate`` for resampling values that were drawn below zero. If the last option is chosen, the additional argument ``negative_sample_max_retries`` controls how often the values are resampled.

   count and percentage of finite pre-clip (unscaled) gradient norms exceeding
   this threshold, plus the median, 90th, and 99th percentiles (excluding
   NaN-loss steps and counting non-finite AMP norms separately). With
   TensorBoard enabled, epoch summaries are also written under
   ``train/gradient_clipping/{threshold,checked_steps,finite_steps,nonfinite_steps,clipped_steps,clipped_fraction,norm_median,norm_p90,norm_p99}``
   (``clipped_fraction`` in ``[0, 1]`` and percentiles are omitted when
   ``finite_steps == 0``).

-  ``lazy_load``: Whether to access data lazily rather than load all in-memory. Each batch is loaded dynamically. Default: ``False``.
-  ``max_basins_in_memory``: Maximum number of basins to keep in memory at one time during training and evaluation. ``0`` (default) disables the limit and loads all basins at once. See `Limiting basins in memory`_.

Limiting basins in memory
-------------------------

``max_basins_in_memory: W`` keeps at most ``W`` basins in memory at one time.
Set ``max_basins_in_memory: 0`` (the default) to load all basins at once.

During training, the full basin list is shuffled once using ``seed`` and split
into non-overlapping groups of at most ``W`` basins. Each training epoch loads
the next group in order. After ``ceil(n_basins / W)`` epochs, every basin has
been used once and the cycle repeats from the first group.

During validation and testing, basins are evaluated in groups of at most ``W``
basins and unloaded after evaluation finishes.

Important notes:

-  **Each epoch uses fewer basins.** When ``max_basins_in_memory: W`` is set,
   one epoch trains on ``W`` basins instead of all basins. You may want to
   multiply epoch-based settings (``epochs``, ``learning_rate_epochs_drop``,
   ``validate_every``, and ``save_weights_every``) by ``ceil(n_basins / W)`` to
   keep the same total number of training updates.
-  **Normalization still uses all basins.** The data scaler is computed across
   all training basins before the first group of basins is loaded.

Temporal alignment of forecasts
-------------------------------

Forecast runs follow the Caravan-MultiMet convention (Shalev et al., 2026,
Section 2.1). All daily data are left-labelled in UTC, so the value stored under
date ``D`` covers ``[D 00:00, D+1 00:00)``. Forecast products are indexed by
issue date, and their ``lead_time`` coordinate is 1-indexed: ``lead_time = 1
day`` on issue date ``D`` covers the same calendar day ``D``, ``lead_time = 2
days`` covers ``D + 1``, and so on.

For a sample issued on date ``D`` the dataset therefore builds:

-  **Hindcast inputs** (2D nowcast products, and forecast products used as
   hindcast inputs at their first lead time) covering the ``seq_length``
   completed days ``[D - seq_length, ..., D - 1]``.
-  **Forecast inputs** issued on ``D`` across lead times ``1 .. lead_time``,
   valid on ``[D, ..., D + lead_time - 1]``, optionally preceded by
   ``forecast_overlap`` days of first-lead-time forecasts ending on ``D - 1``.
-  **Targets** (and the ``date`` array of a sample) ending on
   ``D + lead_time - 1``.

Result files written by evaluation are indexed by the issue date ``D`` and by
``time_step``: ``time_step = k >= 1`` is the forecast with ``lead_time = k``
(valid on ``D + k - 1``), while ``time_step <= 0`` are hindcast days
(``time_step = 0`` is ``D - 1``).

Finetune settings
-----------------

Ignored if ``mode != finetune``

-  ``base_run_dir``: Path to the pre-trained model run directory containing ``config.yml``, ``scaler.zarr``, and ``model_epochXXX.pt``.
-  ``finetune_modules``: List (or dictionary) of model submodule attribute names (``module_parts``) that will be trained
   during fine-tuning. Only parts listed here will be
   updated during fine-tuning; all other weights are frozen.

   -  For ``mean_embedding_forecast_lstm``: ``static_embedding_fc``, ``hindcast_embeddings_fc``, ``forecast_embeddings_fc``, ``shared_embeddings_fc``, ``hindcast_lstm``, ``forecast_lstm``, ``head``.
   -  For ``handoff_forecast_lstm``: ``statics_embedding_net``, ``hindcast_embedding_net``, ``forecast_embedding_net``, ``hindcast_lstm``, ``forecast_lstm``, ``handoff_net``, ``hindcast_head``, ``forecast_head``.

Logger settings
---------------

-  ``log_interval``: Interval at which the training loss is logged, 
   by default 10.

-  ``log_tensorboard``: True/False. If True, writes logging results into
   TensorBoard file. The default, if not specified, is True.

-  ``log_n_figures``: If a (integer) value greater than 0, saves the
   predictions as plots of that n specific (random) basins during
   validations.

-  ``log_loss_every_nth_update``: Refresh rate of logging of the loss value
   every n iterations. For example for ``20``, the loss logging would be
   updated every 20 iterations (updates) during training. Logging loss has
   performance cost (waits to transfer memory from GPU to CPU instead of
   additional iterations). For example, for ``mean_embedding_forecast_lstm``,
   a value of 5 saves 50ms per iteration on average which translates to 1.5h
   given 2000 updates for 30 epochs.

-  ``save_git_diff``: If set to True and OpenHydroNet is a git repository
   with uncommitted changes, the git diff will be stored in the run directory.
   When using this option, make sure that your run and data directories are either
   not located inside the git repository, or that they are part of the ``.gitignore`` file.
   Otherwise, the git diff may become very large and use up a lot of disk space.
   To make sure everything is configured correctly, you can simply check that the
   output of ``git diff HEAD`` only contains your code changes.
